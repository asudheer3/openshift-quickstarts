Eloqua is a marketing automation platform (MAP), now owned by Oracle. This software is used by marketers, primarily B2B marketers, to help automate the lead generation process. Eloqua and it’s ilk all have a database which stores prospect and customer information, an emailer which sends email to prospects and customers, and a website monitoring system which tracks prospect and customer activity on websites under control of the marketer.
</p><p>
The database stores prospect and customer information like name, address, company, job title, email address and phone number - demographic information. It also stores behavioral information, like what people did on our website, what they viewed, when they visited, which of our emails did they receive, which did they open, and other information that may help the marketer understand prospect or customer behavior.
</p><p>
The emailer sends messages, sometimes manually in batches, often one by one automatically when some condition the marketer has set is seen by Eloqua. For example, many marketers use a MAP to send out a batch of email to a number of people in the database. Good MAPs like Eloqua can customize each email with recipients’ names and more to make them appear more personalized. Eloqua also can send an email automatically when, for example, a known visitor downloads something from your website, or other trigger. The conditions that may cause emails to be sent can be as simple or as complex as the software will allow - or the marketer can create. 
</p><p>
The website monitor uses cookies to recognize visitors and record their behavior in the database. These monitors usually consist of a few lines of website code on each page that tell Eloqua when each and every visitor clicks on something. That information is recorded in the database to build a record of prospect or customer behavior.
</p><p>
MAPs are often connected to sales automation tools like Salesforce.com to automate communications between marketing and sales teams.
</p><p>
Marketers using Eloqua or any other good MAP can develop a large database of potential and existing buyers, and track their interest in buying products through their online behavior - their responses to emails and their website visits. Then they can use that information to determine next marketing steps - send them more information or, perhaps, talk to a salesperson.
</p><p>
Of course, this is a simplified explanation, but the three components - database, email and website monitoring - are common to all marketing automation tools. Marketers can use these tools as manually or as automatically as they want, or as they dare, to generate leads for their sales teams or channel partners.s
